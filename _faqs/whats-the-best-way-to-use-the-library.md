Here is the canonical example for serializing and deserializing with ArduinoJson.

By following this example, you are making the best usage of your memory and you maintain a good software design.

```c++
struct SensorData {
   const char* name;
   int time;
   float value;
};

#define SENSORDATA_JSON_SIZE (JSON_OBJECT_SIZE(3))

bool deserialize(SensorData& data, char* json)
{
    StaticJsonBuffer<SENSORDATA_JSON_SIZE> jsonBuffer;
    JsonObject& root = jsonBuffer.parseObject(json);
    data.name = root["name"];
    data.time = root["time"];
    data.value = root["value"];
    return root.success();
}

void serialize(const SensorData& data, char* json, size_t maxSize)
{
    StaticJsonBuffer<SENSORDATA_JSON_SIZE> jsonBuffer;
    JsonObject& root = jsonBuffer.createObject();
    root["name"] = data.name;
    root["time"] = data.time;
    root["value"] = data.value;
    root.printTo(json, maxSize);
}
```

As you can see the `StaticJsonBuffer` is kept in memory as short as possible, so that the remain of your program is unaffected by the JSON serialization.

Also you can see that neither [`JsonArray`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/jsonarray/) nor [`JsonObject`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/jsonobject/) leak out of the serialization code. This maintain a good isolation and reduce the coupling with the library.

If you are interested in writing good code and make the best possible use of the library, be sure to check the [ArduinoJson ebook]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link book/index.md %}).

By understanding how the library is made, you will certainly make a better use of it. In particular, it is essential to prevent useless duplication, as time and memory is precious in an embedded environment.

The book also contains a quick C++ course to catch up with pointers, references, and memory management. Indeed, the most common source of pain with ArduinoJson is a lake of understanding of basic C++ concepts.
