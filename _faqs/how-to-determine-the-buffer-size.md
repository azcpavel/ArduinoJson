There are basically two radically different approaches:

1. compute the buffer size from the input layout
2. use whatever amount of memory is available.

## Compute the buffer size from the input layout

In this situation, we assume that you know what kind of input you want to parse.
From that, we can predict how the JSON will be stored in memory and therefore compute the required space.

For instance, let's say that you know in advance (and by that I mean "at compilation time") that you want to generate an object with 3 values, one of them being an array with 2 values, like the following:

    {"sensor":"gps","time":1351824120,"data":[48.756080,2.302038]}

To determine the memory usage of this object tree, you use the two macros `JSON_ARRAY_SIZE(n)` and `JSON_OBJECT_SIZE(n)`, both take the number of elements as an argument.
For the example above, it would be:

    const int BUFFER_SIZE = JSON_OBJECT_SIZE(3) + JSON_ARRAY_SIZE(2);
    StaticJsonBuffer<BUFFER_SIZE> jsonBuffer;

This is really cumbersome and error prone, that's why there is a tool for that: the [ArduinoJson Assistant]({{ site.baseurl }}/assistant/).
Simply a sample JSON in the [ArduinoJson Assistant]({{ site.baseurl }}/assistant/) and it will return the buffer size.

## Use whatever amount of memory is available.

In the second case, let's say you dynamically generate a JSON object tree of a random complexity so you can't put a limit based on that.
But on the other hand, you don't want your program to crash because the object tree doesn't fit in memory.
The solution here is to determine how much memory is available, or in other words how much memory you can afford for the JSON object tree.

The [ArduinoJson ebook]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link book/index.md %}) details how [`JsonArray`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/jsonarray/) and [`JsonObject`]({{site.baseurl}}/api/jsonobject/) are represented in memory, and therefore how the computation of the size is done.

The chapter "Inside ArduinoJson" describes `StaticJsonBuffer` and `DynamicJsonBuffer` in detail. It explains how they differ and how to choose between one and the other.

It also explains the difference between "stack," "heap" and "global" memories. Understanding these concepts is crucial to the success of any deeply embedded project.
